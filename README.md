# Sales Dashboard using PowerBI
       
### I have created interactive Sales dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. Below are the visuals I have added in dashboard and how they help in analysis.

•	We can see how these (total sales, total profit, and total customers) metrics have changed over time and identify any trends or patterns.

•	In sales by segment chart we can see the proportion of sales from each segment: Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office. We can also compare the sales by segment with the previous years and see if there are any significant changes or differences.

•	In sales by region chart we can see the distribution of sales across different regions: Central, East, South, and West. We can see if there are any regional variations or preferences.

•	In the sales by sub-category visual we can see the breakdown of sales by different sub-categories of products: Accessories, Appliances, Art, Binders, Bookcases, Chairs, Copiers, Envelopes, Fasteners, etc. We can also compare the sales by sub-category with the previous years and see which products are more or less popular or profitable.

• The city slicer can give you more indetail data for particular cities.

The dashboard is based on hypothetical data
